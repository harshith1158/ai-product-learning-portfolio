AI Product Learning Portfolio :

This repository contains applied AI Product Management work created while completing:
- AI Product Management: Strategy, Roadmaps & ChatGPT (Udemy)
- AI for Product Management (Pendo AI)

 Flagship Project
 
 "AI-Powered Customer Support Assistant"

In this project, I designed an AI-driven customer support solution from problem discovery to post-launch evaluation.

It demonstrates:
- Product strategy & problem framing
- User persona development
- Feature prioritization & roadmapping
- AI system design (RAG, safety, compliance)
- Metrics & experimentation
- Risk analysis & continuous improvement

The project simulates the real responsibilities of an AI Product Manager working with engineering, design, and business stakeholders.
