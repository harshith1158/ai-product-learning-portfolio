Problem

Customers experience slow, inconsistent, and expensive support. Key problems:
- Long wait times and inconsistent answers across channels (chat, email, phone).
- High volume of repetitive queries leading to agent overload and burnout.
- Knowledge bases fragmented across systems and hard to search.
- New product updates cause stale or incorrect support information.
- Need for multilingual, 24/7 coverage and rapid escalation for complex issues.
- Compliance, privacy, and auditability requirements for responses.

Goal: Build an AI Customer Support Assistant that reduces time-to-first-response, improves answer consistency and accuracy, deflects routine queries from human agents, and increases customer and agent satisfaction while maintaining safety and compliance.
